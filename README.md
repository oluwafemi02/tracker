- **Vercel** (free)
- **Firebase Hosting** (free)

### Option 2: Web Server
Host on any web server with HTTPS support:
- Apache
- Nginx
- Node.js/Express

### Required Headers
Ensure your server sends these headers:
```
Cache-Control: max-age=31536000 # For icons and static assets
Service-Worker-Allowed: / # For service worker scope
```

## 🔐 HTTPS Requirement

**PWAs require HTTPS** for all features to work properly. This includes:
- Service Worker registration
- Push notifications
- Add to Home Screen
- Offline functionality

Use a service like Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
- **"Add to Home Screen" not showing**: Ensure you're using Safari on iOS, not Chrome or other browsers
- **App not installing**: Check that you have HTTPS and a valid manifest.json
- **Icons not showing**: Verify icon files exist and are properly sized

### Notification Issues
- **No notification prompt**: Must be on HTTPS and user must interact with the page first
- **Notifications not working**: Check iOS Settings > Notifications > ExpenseTracker
- **No badges**: Ensure Badging API permission is granted

### Performance Issues
- **Slow loading**: Enable service worker caching for better performance
- **High memory usage**: Clear old cached data regularly
- **Offline not working**: Check service worker is properly registered

## 📈 Advanced Features

### Custom Notifications
Customize notification behavior by modifying the service worker:

```javascript
// In sw.js - customize notification appearance
const options = {
  body: 'Custom notification text',
  icon: '/icons/icon-192x192.png',
  badge: '/icons/badge-72x72.png',
  actions: [
    { action: 'view', title: 'View Details' },
    { action: 'dismiss', title: 'Dismiss' }
  ]
};
```

### Offline Data Storage
The app uses IndexedDB for offline storage with automatic sync when online.

### Background Sync
Automatically syncs data when connection is restored using Background Sync API.
